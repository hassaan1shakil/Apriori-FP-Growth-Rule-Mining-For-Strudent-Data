# Apriori-FP-Growth-Rule-Mining-For-Student-Data

### **Introduction**  

This notebook explores **pattern mining** techniques to uncover hidden relationships in student data. By applying **association rule mining**, key insights about student behaviors, socio-economic factors, and academic performance are extracted.   

### **Techniques Used**  
- **Association Rule Mining** using two approaches:  
  - **Confidence-Based Rules:** Focused on frequent patterns with strong relationships.  
  - **Interest-Based Rules (Lift):** Highlighted socio-economic trends.  

This notebook provides **data-driven insights** into student behaviors, helping institutions make informed decisions on academic policies and support systems. All of these insights in detail are recorded in the report. It is to be noted that the input dataset is very small leading to a limited extraction of association rules.
